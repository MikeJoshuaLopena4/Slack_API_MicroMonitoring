Project Description: Real-time Data Processing System with Slack Integration


Overview:
The project aims to develop a robust data ingestion system capable of processing a continuous stream 
of input data in real-time. Using Go language for backend development and HTML/CSS/JS for frontend,
the system will handle data ingestion, perform analysis, and provide real-time insights. Integration 
with Slack via its API pub/sub feature will enable the system to send notifications based on analyzed data.
The system will utilize Google Cloud Platform's Spanner database for efficient storage and retrieval of processed data.
